## Augur: Predictive Supply Chain Management System
Overview
Augur is a browser-based dashboard for PepsiCo distributors that displays:

Distributor name

Year-to-date (YTD) average quantity of goods shipped

Quantity shipped last month

Forecasted quantity to be shipped this month

It integrates with existing predictive shipping pipelines and is built with scalability and extendibility in mind.

The system is deployed on Microsoft Azure.
